# dsts

Data structures, but in Typescript

## Development

This project uses `prettier` and `tslint` to maintain the code stylistically and `ava` to maintain the tests. All of the code written for this project is written in Typescript.

Git hooks will automatically format for each commit but it's highly recommended that you use a prettier and tslint plugin for your IDE.

### Installation

Running an `npm install` will pull down all the dependencies that are necessary to get this working.

### Running

There isn't much of "running" this repository in the traditional sense. Running an `npm test` will run the tests and generate a coverage report. The coverage report can be looked at using `npm run open-coverage-report`.
