# dsts

Data structures, but in Typescript

## Installation

Running an `npm install` will pull down all the dependencies that are necessary to get this working.

## Running

There isn't much of "running" this repository in the traditional sense. Running an `npm test` will run the tests and generate a coverage report. The coverage report can be looked at using `npm run open-coverage-report`.
